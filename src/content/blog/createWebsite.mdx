Next.js + TailwindCSS + TypeScript. Pulled from [@DerekHu](https://github.com/derekhut)’s open source repo. Learned a lot. Now I have a portfolio I’m proud of. ✨

## Why I Built It

As a Computer Programming student looking for co-op opportunities, I needed a clean, focused way to showcase my projects, experience, and technical growth. A personal website felt like the best way to do that — and it also gave me a reason to practice web development outside of schoolwork.

## The Stack

I used a modern and lightweight stack that keeps things fast, readable, and easy to maintain:

- **Next.js** – for file-based routing, SSR/SSG, and React-based flexibility
- **TailwindCSS** – for responsive, utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** – because I want type safety as I grow as a dev
- **Markdown** – for writing blogs like this one easily
- **CustomConfig Files** – to keep all the content centralized (projects, bio, links, etc.)

## What I Learned

- How to structure a Next.js app from a real-world example
- How to manage reusable content using config files and TypeScript
- How to customize components like `CustomIcon`, `SocialLinks`, and dynamic project lists
- How to integrate GitHub links, resume info, and LeetCode activities cleanly into a portfolio

## Special Thanks

Big thanks to [@DerekHu](https://github.com/derekhut) for open-sourcing the template that inspired this project. His architecture made it easy to plug in my own data and iterate on top of it. Check out his original version if you’re looking to build something similar.

## What’s Next

Now that the portfolio is live, I plan to:

- Keep blogging about school projects and learning journeys
- Embed interactive project demos when available

Thanks for reading!
